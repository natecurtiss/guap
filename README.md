## Mirage

**Mirage is a small 2D game engine written in 24 hours, because why not?** It's definitely not perfect but it's usable, and it's the first complete game engine I've ever made.

## Specifications

- Runs on Windows exclusively because of [System.Drawing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Drawing.Common/) :/
- Built and used with C# and .NET 6
- 2D Sprite rendering with OpenGL
- Keyboard inputs
- Lots of extendability
